# Release Notes

## v0.0.2 (2026-10-17)

### Architectural & Performance Upgrades
- **Head + Tail L1 Active Observation Elision (`tether/context.py`)**: Oversized active observations (`> 2,400 chars`) are deterministically elided in L1 working memory to their first 900 chars + last 900 chars with a pointer to `mem recall` / `mem search`, preserving full outputs in SQLite FTS5.
- **Deterministic Loop-Stall Breaker (`tether/harness.py`)**: Consecutive identical `(cmd, stdin)` calls from small 8B/9B models are intercepted before tool execution and answered with a deterministic `[LOOP DETECTED]` recovery nudge.
- **100% KV-Cache Prefix Immutability Across Pins (`tether/context.py`, `tether/providers/anthropic.py`)**: `[PINNED MEMORY]` is attached to the tail message after window trimming so earlier turn messages remain 100% byte-identical when pins change; added Anthropic ephemeral `cache_control` breakpoints.
- **Persistent Connection Pooling & Thread-Local SQLite WAL (`tether/providers/*`, `tether/store.py`)**: Reuses persistent `httpx.AsyncClient` instances across turns and caches thread-local SQLite WAL connections with in-memory temp store and 128 MB mmap.
- **SDK Custom Provider Registry (`register_provider`)**: Added `register_provider(prefix, factory)` for clean SDK routing of custom model gateways and local runners.
- **100% Unit & Integration Test Coverage + CI**: Added modular per-file test suite (`tests/`) and GitHub Actions CI enforcing `ruff`, `mypy`, and `pytest --cov=tether --cov-fail-under=100`.

## v0.0.1 (2026-10-16)

### Initial Release
- Single `act(cmd, stdin)` action multiplexer with `< 150` tokens of base framing overhead.
- `@tool` Python function introspection with JIT `--help` disclosure (`<= 60` tokens).
- SQLite WAL session store + FTS5 BM25 RAG (`chunks_fts`) and ephemeral $K$-turn observation folding.
- Detached headless worker execution (`tether run --headless`, `wait`, `send`, `query`, `read`, `list`).
- Always-async multi-agent orchestration (`agent spawn`, `wait`, `query`, `read`, `send`).
- Deterministic `SandboxPolicy` with workspace path confinement, secret environment scrubbing, and Linux `bwrap` isolation.
